This is a so-called empty project for Open Game Studio (OGS) Editor.

Overview
========

This project contains the bare minimum of what a normal OGS project could
contain. Its purpose is to serve as a starting point for all new projects
and to explain OGS project hierarchy to newcomers.

Hierarchy
=========
.
├── default.actions
│
│   Contains a list of actions. An action is a set of node property changes.
│   In this case, it contains single action to rotate a scene node by 360
│   degrees along Y axis for 1000 milliseconds.
│
├── default.compositor
│
│   Contains a list of materials. A material is a set of textures applied
│   to a node's model.
│   In this case, it contains diffuse and normal maps (textures) applied
│   to the ball.
│
├── default.lights
│
│   Contains a list of lights. Only directional lights are supported at
│   the moment.
│   In this case, it contains a light with soft shadow map configuration.
│
├── default.scene
│
│   Contains a list of scene nodes and their relationship (parent-child).
│   In this case, it contains:
│   * light
│   * camera
│   * ball
│
├── default.sounds
│
│   Contains a list of sounds. Sound can be represented as a buffer
│   and a stream. Buffer keeps its data in memory (suitable to replay
│   clicks, selections and other short files), whereas stream reads data
│   from a file continuously (suitable to replay a background music).
│   In this case, it contains a sound buffer to replay on game start.
│
├── models
│   │    
│   │   Contains models in OpenSceneGraph format. You can use
│   │   "osgexport" Blender exporter to generate it.
│   │ 
│   └── ball.osgt
│
│       Ball model for the ball scene node.
│
├── pipeline
│   │
│   │   Contains shaders and other pipeline related files.
│   │   In this case, the project uses standard pipeline, so the
│   │   directory has no files.
│   │
│   └── textures
│       │
│       │   Contains PNG files that represent textures.
│       │
│       ├── ball_n.png
│       │   
│       │   Normal map (texture) for the ball material.
│       │    
│       └── ball_tex.png
│
│           Diffuse map (texture) for the ball material.
│
├── player.shortcuts
│
│   Contains a list of shortcuts for when the project is run
│   by the Player.
│   In this case, it specifies that LMB click triggers 'select'
│   shortcut activation.
│
├── README
│
│   This file.
│
├── scripts
│   │
│   │   Contains Python scripts for scene nodes. Each script exports
│   │   its own API into Environment that is shared among the engine
│   │   and all scripts.
│   │
│   ├── Ball.py
│   │
│   │   Provides 'ball...moving' API to rotate the ball. Rotation is
│   │   performed by the above mentioned rotation action.
│   │
│   └── Main.py
│
│       Subscribes to the space key press. When the key is pressed, it
│       uses the above mentioned API to rotate the ball. Also, replays
│       the above mentioned game start sound at the same time.
│
├── sounds
│   │
│   │   Contains sounds in OGG format.
│   │
│   ├── start.ogg
│   │
│   │   Sound to replay when the space key is pressed.
│   │
│   └── start.README
│
│       Explains where the sound file comes from.
│
└── src
    │
    │   Contains sources for necessary resources.
    │
    └── models.blend

        Contains the ball model in Blender format. It was used to generate
        the model itself and its normal map (texture).
