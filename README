This is a so-called empty project for Open Game Studio (OGS) Editor.

Description
===========

This project contains the bare minimum of what a normal OGS project could
contain. Its purpose is to serve as a starting point for all new projects
and to explain OGS project hierarchy to newcomers.

Hierarchy
=========
.
├── default.actions
│
│   Contains a list of actions. An action is a set of node property changes.
│   In this case, it contains single action to rotate a scene node by 360
│   degrees along Y axis for 1000 milliseconds.
│   Loaded by default.
│
├── default.compositor
│
│   Contains a list of materials. A material is a set of textures applied
│   to a node's model.
│   In this case, it contains diffuse and normal maps (textures) applied
│   to the ball.
│   Loaded by default.
│
├── default.lights
│
│   Contains a list of lights. Only directional lights are supported at
│   the moment.
│   In this case, it contains a light with soft shadow map configuration.
│   Loaded by default.
│
├── default.scene
│
│   Contains a list of scene nodes and their relationship (parent-child).
│   In this case, it contains:
│   * light
│   * camera
│   * ball
│   Loaded by default.
│
├── default.sounds
│
│   Contains a list of sounds. Sound can be represented as a buffer
│   and a stream. Buffer keeps its data in memory (suitable to replay
│   clicks, selections and other short files), whereas stream reads data
│   from a file continuously (suitable to replay a background music).
│   In this case, it contains a sound buffer to replay on game start.
│   Loaded by default.
│
├── models
│   │
│       
│   Contains a list of models in OpenSceneGraph format. You can use
│   "osgexport" Blender exporter to generate it.
